## Description

The Interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is an implementation of the classic game where the user plays against the computer using the camera. Each player simultaneously shows one of three hand signals: rock, paper, or scissors. The game logic determines the winner based on the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.

### Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is to provide an interactive and fun implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game using computer vision. By using the camera, the user can actively participate in the game, making it a unique and engaging experience.

### What I Learned

- Implementation of computer vision for gesture recognition.
- Game logic design for Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- Integration of user input from the camera into the game.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rock-paper-scissors.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python camera_rps.py
    ```

## Usage Instructions

- Start the game by running the 'camera_rps.py' script.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to make your gesture using the camera.
- The computer will also make a gesture, and the winner will be determined based on the game rules.
- Enjoy playing Rock-Paper-Scissors in an interactive way!
